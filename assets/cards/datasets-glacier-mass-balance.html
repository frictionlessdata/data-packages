  <h3>Average cumulative mass balance of reference Glaciers worldwide</h3>
  <p>This is cumulative change in mass balance of a set of reference glaciers worldwide beginning in 1945. The values represents the average of all the glaciers that were measured. Negative values indicate a net loss of ice and snow compared with the base year of 1945. For consistency, measurements are in meters of water equivalent, which represent changes in the average thickness of a glacier.</p>
