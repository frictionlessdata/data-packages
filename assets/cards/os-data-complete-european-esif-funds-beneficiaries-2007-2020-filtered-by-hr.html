  <p>Structural and Cohesion Funds are financial tools set up to implement the regional policy of the European Union. They aim to reduce regional disparities in income wealth and opportunities. The overall budget for the 2007-2013 period was â‚¬347 billion according to Wikipedia. This repository is a data pipeline. It channels information about the beneficiaries of the funds into the OpenSpending data store. The goal is to provide a unified data-set that is easy to visualize and query so that citizens and journalists can follow the money on a local and global scale. This project is a collaborative effort between Open-Knowledge Germany, Open Knowledge International and a number of journalists and developers.</p>
