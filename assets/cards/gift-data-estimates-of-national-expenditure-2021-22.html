  <h3>estimates-of-national-expenditure-2021-22</h3>
  <p>This dataset includes expenditure data as published in the Estimates of National Expenditure. Departmental expenditure data in previous financial years have been aligned with the budget and programme structures of departments as they are structured in the current Medium Term Expenditure Framework. This means that the structure of historical expenditure data for a department, may not necessarily reflect the same structure of that department when expenditure was incurred during a particular financial year. This may be due to functions shifts which may have occurred within a particular department or a general change in a departmentâ€™s budget programme structures (BPS) as departments are afforded an opportunity before the start of the Budget to change their BPS.This is to ensure a more economical, efficient and effective delivery of public services and performance by the department as a whole.</p>
