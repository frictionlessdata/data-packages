  <h3>Optical Surveys (2005)</h3>
  <p>Four survey targets (1, 2, 3, 4) were deployed in June 2005 and one (5) in September 2005, within one km of the calving face using a helicopter. The maximum lifetime of the markers was limited to 15 days, before each succumbed to calving. Positions of the targets were obtained using a Leica total station robotic survey theodolite at nominal time separation of 20-30 minutes.</p>
