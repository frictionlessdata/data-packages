  <h3>Men's Shoe Prices</h3>
  <p>A list of 10,000 men's shoes and the various prices at which they are sold.

# About This Data
This is a list of 10,000 men's shoes provided by [Datafiniti's Product Database](https://datafiniti.co/products/product-data/).

The dataset includes shoe name, brand, price, and more. Each shoe will have an entry for each price found for it and some shoes may have multiple entries.

*Note that this is a sample of a large dataset. The full dataset is available through Datafiniti.*

# What You Can Do with This Data
You can use this data to [determine brand markups, pricing strategies, and trends for luxury shoes](https://datafiniti.co/cost-of-designer-label/). E.g.:

* What is the average price of each distinct brand listed?
* Which brands have the highest prices?  
* Which ones have the widest distribution of prices?
* Is there a typical price distribution (e.g., normal) across brands or within specific brands?

Further processing data would also let you:
* Correlate specific product features with changes in price.
* You can cross-reference this data with a sample of our [Women's Shoe Prices](https://data.world/datafiniti/womens-shoe-prices) to see if there are any differences between women's brands and men's brands.
