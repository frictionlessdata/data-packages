Many quoted price series may correspond to multiple bond similar issues.  Callable bonds (10-40s and 5-20s) have multiple entries, one for a potential call in each year. Metadata on state bonds is rather scarce.Sometimes a range of years is known; in which case, there is a bond issue for each year.If no range is known, then a bond issue for each potential year is used (based on the empirical distribution of all bonds for which maturity years are known). The data are an  object , with anEach bond issue is an  object  containting the following entries. cashflows :  object date :  array .

      <h5>burdekin_langdana_1993_war</h5>
    <p>Confederate War News from Burdekin and Langdana (1993) This is set to +1 for 1863Q3 after Chancellorsville and during Lee'sMaryland campaign, -1 for 1862Q2 (Peninsula Campaign), 1863:4 (Gettysburg and Vicksburg) and 1864:1 (costly battle of Chickamagua).  Their guideline for constructing the dummy was Schwab (1901, ch 9) major 'crises of confidence' in Richmond. The dummy variable is set to 0 in 1864:2 and 1864:3 due to the stalled Overland and Petersburg campaigns and the nomination of McClellan.  These data extend the original data by setting it to -1 for 1864Q4 and 1865Q1 although the Burdekin and Langdana analysis stops in 1864Q3 due to a lack of data in other variables.</p>

      <h5>confederate_bonds</h5>
    <p>Confederate interest rates 1861-1865 Data on the gold yields of multiple Confederate bonds between January 1862 andDecember 1864 from [DavisPecquet1990]_, Table 2, p. 148. The note from the original data  (p. 147) reads Five price series form the basis for the calculations used in this article. The five seriesare the Confederate dollar prices of a gold dollar; bonds from the $100 million loan;bonds from the $15 million loan; Virginia state bonds; and Richmond city bonds. Thedata come from market reports in Richmond newspapers, including the RichmondWhig, the Richmond Sentinel, the Richmond Enquirer, and the Richmond Dispatch. Wealso have some quotations for railroad bonds from these papers. The data for thesummer months of 1864 come from the Wilmington Journal of Wilmington, NC, due toa lack of bond price quotations in the Richmond market. The bond quotations weretaken from reports as near as possible to mid-month. Gold price quotations were takennearest the date of bond quotation from the $100 million loan. When a range was givenwe took the upper bound for the long-term rate, and when more than one quote wasavailable on a particular maturity date or on gold an average was taken. The gold pricesfor two dates-August 1863 and October 1864-were obtained by interpolation usingdata from Richard Todd as a guide. In order to calculate yields to maturity it is necessary to have a maturity date. The dayand month of maturity were not known for any issue so we used mid-year, July 1. The$15 million loan matured in 1871. There were various maturity dates for the other issues.For the $100 million loan there were many maturity dates. When maturity dates werereported we used the issues that matured in 1881, or the year nearest to that datebecause it was the most often reported. For about the first year and a half of the periodunder study the maturity dates on bonds from the $100 million loan were unspecified.We took this to mean that the yield curve was flat and so used 1881 as the maturity date.The maturity date was seldom given for the Virginia state and Richmond city bonds, sowe chose the year 1887. In that year some bonds did mature, and it was roughly theaverage maturity date for the dated long-term issues that we do have. Some experimen-tation with alternative dates revealed that the arguments and conclusions of the text arenot sensitive to different maturity dates. The actual market date was used in the calculation of the yield to maturity. All of theraw data are available on request from the authors. The data used to construct thediagrams are presented in Table 2.</p>

    <p>Price of Gold in Confederate Currency (Graybacks) from McCandless Biweekly grayback price series from McCandless (1996), Appendix Table1, p. 669. The data for the South comes from a newspaper column (of unknownorigin) found glued into a blank back page of the Virginia StateLibrary's copy of Ernest A. Smith's (1901) The History of theConfederate Treasury.As best I can tell, this Southern data set has not been usedbefore. The standardreference is from the Hammond papers, a copyof a card issued by the Wm. B. Isaacs & Co., bankers with monthlyprices for the North on one side and for the South on theother. This is the source of the frequently referenced Southernprices in Todd's Confederate Finance. An additional source ofSouthern prices is from a letter to the New York Evening Post ofAugust 4, 1896 where prices are given for every 10 days. Theauthor of the letter is identified only as E. C. M. The data fromthe Isaccs and ECM sources are similar to what I use. Weidenmier (2002) discusses problems with this series, contrasting itwith his data. Problems with the grayback series is that it reports constant pricesfor weeks at a time, is of unknown origin for an unknown market, isinconsistent with the New York Evening Post price series (On Jan 1,1865 the Post lists a price of 34 for 1 while McCandless reports 60for 1), and it is unclear whether they are bid or ask prices. \textcite{Weidenmier2002}</p>

    <p>Price of gold in Confederate Dollars (Graybacks) from Weidenmier (2002) This price series is from the same sources as  grayback_weidenmier_2 ,but only includes Richmond prices, is higher frequency (weekly ratherthan biweekly), and includes a longer range of dates.  From Weidenmier (2002), p. 878 An extensive search of more than a dozen newspapers yielded aseries of 486 grayback prices from public auctions and privatebrokerage trades in Richmond between May 27, 1861, and February 15,1865. From Weidenmier (2002), footnote 2, p. 878 All quotes are taken from Richmond except during somestretches in the summer and fall of 1864 when Richmondnewspapers stopped reporting money prices. These periods arefilled in by gold price quotations from the nearby Wilmington,North Carolina, money market, whose prices were often quotedin the Richmond newspapers.  Newspapers from Petersburg, NorthCarolina, Virginia,Mobile, Alabama, Wilmington, Virginia,Raleigh, North Carolina, Lynchburg, Augusta, Georgia,Columbus, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, were alsoexamined for price quotes from the Richmond market(seeAppendix).Often, these papers would quote trades not reportedin the Richmond newspapers.  In addition, secondary marketsexisted in most of these cities, although these gold exchangestended to be considerably less liquid than the Richmondmarket. From Weidenmier (2002), p. 890, Grayback/gold price quotations were taken from the followingnewspapers:Richmond Dispatch, Richmond Examiner, RichmondWhig, Richmond Enquirer, Petersburg Express,Wilmington Journal, Columbus Daily-Sun,Charleston Mercury,Lynchburg Virginian,and the MobileTribune.Richmondgrayback/gold price quotations were alsocross-checked against prices in the Raleigh, Augusta,and Mobilegold markets using the following newspapers: RaleighWeekly Register, Mobile Tribune,Mobile Advertiser and Register,and Augusta Daily Constitutionalist.</p>

      <h5>greenbacks</h5>
    <p>Daily price of greenbacks in gold in New York (1862-1879)The price of greenbacks comes from Mitchel (1908), which was put in machine format by Willard et. al. and made available on http://eh.net/databases/greenback/. The data here correct several mistakes in that data.Wesley Mitchell's (1903) daily series of the price of a gold dollar in greenbacks in New York.Note from Mitchell (1903), p. 423 Explanatory Note. There are two well-authenticated tables thatshow the average monthly and yearly value of currency in goldduring the Civil War: (1) a table published by the AmericanAlmanac (see, e.g., issue of 1889, p. 3(1); (2) a tableprepared by the Bureau of Statistics (Finance, Commerce andImmigration of the United States, Series of 1895--96, No. 4,p. 518). For the years 1862--65 these tables are identical; thefigures given below are taken from the second. This table wasprepared by Mr. E B. Elliott, actuary of tho treasury, in thefollowing manner: four dally quotations of the rates of goldat New York, viz., the opening, highest, lowest, and closingprices, were recorded; from them a daily average was made, andfrom these average daily prices was prepared the average ratefor each month.The table of daily highest and lowest prices is based, for thereasons assigned in the text (Part II, chap, iii, sec. i), uponthe tables given in the Report of the Chamber of Commerce of theState of New York for 1865-66, Part II, pp. 130--33. The figuresfor the first eleven days of January, 1862, however, are suppliedfrom the daily reports of the premium on gold in the New YorkCommercial Advertiser. Daily series of the price of a gold dollar in greenbacks in New York from Wesley C. Mitchell  Gold, Prices, and Wages under the Greenback Standard , Appendix, Table 1: "Daily highest and lowest premium on gold and price of greenbacks in gold", pp. 288--338.Mitchell's more extensive discussion of these data on p. 185--187. The price of gold in currency, as determined by transactions in theseNew York markets, was regularly reported by telegraph in allconsiderable towns of the United States, and everywhere accepted asauthoritative. There is no necessity for taking account of the premiumon gold in other places, because local markets were dominated by theNew York quotations. The money columns of the daily newspapers and theweekly or monthly issues of the financial journals gave full reportsof current fluctuations, and more permanent records were made by thecompilation of a number of tables showing the highest and lowestprices each day for a series of years. Such tables may be found in*Hunt's Merchants' Magazine*, the *Commercial and Financial Chronicle*,the *Bankers' Magazine*, and the annual *Reports of the Chamber ofCommerce of the State of New York*.All of these tables appear to be constructed in the same generalmanner from the recorded transactions of the most important of theNew York markets. From January 13, 1862, to June 20, 1864, theyare based upon sales at the stock exchange. On June 21 the "goldbill" went into effect and stopped all dealing in gold outside theprivate offices of brokers. From this time until the repeal of the"gold bill" by the act of July 2, there was no organized market,and the quotations are those ruling on the street. After therepeal, transactions in gold on the stock exchange wereinfrequent, and most of the business was done in the "gold room."From July 1864 on, therefore, the tables are based upon the lattermarket.In studying the fluctuations in the gold value of the papercurrency it is necessary to go back to these records of the dailypremium. As the differences between the tables mentioned areslight, it matters little which set is accepted as a basis for theinvestigation. I have decided to use the tables published in thechamber of commerce reports, not only because of the officialcharacter of the source from which they are taken, but alsobecause they contain fewer obvious errors of the press than someof the others. To adapt them better to the purposes of the presentchapter I have altered their form. As published, the tables showthe highest and lowest price paid each day in currency for $100 ingold. This form of statement gives the impression that thefluctuations were due to extraordinary changes in the valuation atwhich gold was held by the community, whereas in fact they weredue mainly to changes in the community's valuation of the notes ofthe government. When the market quotation was 200 the explanation,of course, was not that men esteemed gold twice as highly as theyhad done in 1861, but rather that they esteemed the paper currencybut half as highly as they had when it was redeemable in specie. Amuch juster impression of the significance of the change in therelative values of gold and paper money is therefore given byquoting currency at a discount in gold than by quoting gold at apremium in paper; by saying, to use a numerical example, that $100in greenbacks was-worth $50 in gold, than by saying that $100 ingold was worth $200 in greenbacks. For this reason the chamber ofcommerce tables for the years 1862 to 1865 have been convertedinto tables showing the highest and lowest daily prices ofcurrency in gold. These tables, given in full in the Appendix,furnish a basis for studying the remarkable changes in the goldvalue of the currency during the Civil War. The original data source for Mitchell is the  Report of the Chamber of Commerce , which can be found at http://books.google.com/books?id=9X8pAAAAYAAJ.This data in this table was taken from  EH.net Greenback Series <http://eh.net/databases/greenback/> . The associated documentation reads, We did not collect the data in the usual sense; we simply copied it from the tables in:Mitchell, Wesley C., 1903. A history of the Greenbacks. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. However, Mitchell (1903) only includes greenback prices from 1862-1865 on pp. 425-428. they must have actually copied it from Mitchell (1908) which  has prices from 1903-1908.Mitchell (1908, p. 2-3) discusses the data, The prices of gold in these various exchanges were regularly reportedin the financial columns of the daily papers-often in much detail. Thefinancial journals-such as *Hunt's Merchants' Magazine*, the *Bankers'Magazine*, and the *Commercial and Financial Chronicle* --- usuallycontented themselves with publishing the opening, highest, lowest, andclosing prices for each day. At intervals they compiled summary tablesof daily highest and lowest prices for months or years. Similar tableswere included in the statistical reports of such bodies as the Chamberof Commerce of the State of New York, and in the almanacs issued byvarious newspapers.A more detailed record of the price of gold was preserved for most ofthe years of the paper standard in an annual publication issued byMr. J. C. Mersereau, Register of the Gold Exchange, under the title"American Gold, 1862-(date of issue)." This little volume usually gavefor the preceding year the quotation for gold at ten o'clock and everyquarter hour thereafter until three in the afternoon of each businessday, and in all cases it gave the highest and lowest prices for everybusiness day from January 13, 1862, when gold was first quoted on theStock Exchange to the end of the previous year.  The tables of daily highest and lowest prices of gold found in themost important of these sources---namely: the *Commercial and FinancialChronicle*, the *Reports of the Chamber of Commerce of the State ofNew York*, and Mersereau's *American Gold* --- are in close agreementwith each other. Numerous small discrepancies exist --- the quotationsfrequently vary by an eighth, sometimes by a quarter; but it matterslittle which set of tables is followed. Since Mersereau was theofficial register of the Gold Exchange, however, his tables takeprecedence in authority. Accordingly, Table 1, in the appendix, whichgives the daily highest and lowest prices of gold, is based on"*American Gold*, 1862-1878''—the latest issue of Mersereau's annual Ihave been able to find. To guard against repeating the typographicalerrors which occur in Mersereau's table I have collated it with theChamber of Commerce table and made several corrections. SinceMersereau's table is not available for 1878, the Chamber of Commercefigures, checked by those of the Commercial and Financial Chronicle,are used for the last year of the paper standard. To save space thepremium on gold is given, instead of the price of gold in currency;and, to facilitate study of the depreciation in the specie value ofthe currency, columns have been added giving the prices of greenbacksin gold corresponding to the daily highest and lowest premiums on goldin greenbacks.Mersereau does not state explicitly from what markets his quotationsare taken; but comparison with other reports indicate that they referto the Stock Exchange for January 13, 1862, to June 20, 1864, andthereafter to the Gold Exchange, except for the first part of October,1869, when the Gold Exchange was closed and dealings were conducted onthe Stock Exchange. The data for January 1-11, 1862, I have suppliedfrom the financial columns of New York daily papers. The original data in Mitchell includes columns for "Premium on gold" and "Price of Greenbacks in Gold". The Willard, et. al. version only includes the greenback prices column.I was not able to find a full-text version of the original source of Mitchell's data, "American Gold" by J.C. Mersereau on Google books (October 2011).[Mitchell1903]_ (p. 425-428) includes a similar table of greenback prices in gold for the years 1862-1865, which uses  Report of the Chamber of Commerce of the of New York  for 1865-66, Part II, pp. 130-33 as its source.</p>
