    <p>Confederate War News from Burdekin and Langdana (1993)

This is set to +1 for 1863Q3 after Chancellorsville and during Lee's
Maryland campaign, -1 for 1862Q2 (Peninsula Campaign), 1863:4 (Gettysburg and Vicksburg) and 1864:1 (costly battle of Chickamagua).  Their guideline for constructing the dummy was Schwab (1901, ch 9) major 'crises of confidence' in Richmond. The dummy variable is set to 0 in 1864:2 and 1864:3 due to the stalled Overland and Petersburg campaigns and the nomination of McClellan. 

These data extend the original data by setting it to -1 for 1864Q4 and 1865Q1 although the Burdekin and Langdana analysis stops in 1864Q3 due to a lack of data in other variables.

    <p>Confederate interest rates 1861-1865

Data on the gold yields of multiple Confederate bonds between January 1862 and
December 1864 from [DavisPecquet1990]_, Table 2, p. 148.

The note from the original data  (p. 147) reads

  Five price series form the basis for the calculations used in this article. The five series
  are the Confederate dollar prices of a gold dollar; bonds from the $100 million loan;
  bonds from the $15 million loan; Virginia state bonds; and Richmond city bonds. The
  data come from market reports in Richmond newspapers, including the Richmond
  Whig, the Richmond Sentinel, the Richmond Enquirer, and the Richmond Dispatch. We
  also have some quotations for railroad bonds from these papers. The data for the
  summer months of 1864 come from the Wilmington Journal of Wilmington, NC, due to
  a lack of bond price quotations in the Richmond market. The bond quotations were
  taken from reports as near as possible to mid-month. Gold price quotations were taken
  nearest the date of bond quotation from the $100 million loan. When a range was given
  we took the upper bound for the long-term rate, and when more than one quote was
  available on a particular maturity date or on gold an average was taken. The gold prices
  for two dates-August 1863 and October 1864-were obtained by interpolation using
  data from Richard Todd as a guide.

  In order to calculate yields to maturity it is necessary to have a maturity date. The day
  and month of maturity were not known for any issue so we used mid-year, July 1. The
  $15 million loan matured in 1871. There were various maturity dates for the other issues.
  For the $100 million loan there were many maturity dates. When maturity dates were
  reported we used the issues that matured in 1881, or the year nearest to that date
  because it was the most often reported. For about the first year and a half of the period
  under study the maturity dates on bonds from the $100 million loan were unspecified.
  We took this to mean that the yield curve was flat and so used 1881 as the maturity date.
  The maturity date was seldom given for the Virginia state and Richmond city bonds, so
  we chose the year 1887. In that year some bonds did mature, and it was roughly the
  average maturity date for the dated long-term issues that we do have. Some experimen-
  tation with alternative dates revealed that the arguments and conclusions of the text are
  not sensitive to different maturity dates.

  The actual market date was used in the calculation of the yield to maturity. All of the
  raw data are available on request from the authors. The data used to construct the
  diagrams are presented in Table 2.

Appendix Tables 2 "Major military events of Civil War" and 3 "Major non-military events of the Civil War" in McCandless (1996), p. 670:

  Included in the list are all events noted as \"Important\", major or
  decisive Catton (1971), Pratt (1948), Guinnane et al. (1993).

The original tables use vague terms such as \"late\" or \"early\". I added exact *start_date* and *end_date* values as follows,
- Fall of New Orleans
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_New_Orleans lists the dates
  of April 25 to May 1.
- Seven Days Battles: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Days_Battle
  Battle of Oak Grove on June 25 to Battle of Malvern Hill on July 1
- Since no exact date was given for the \"Re-election of Lincoln
  certain\", and it does not correspond to a discrete event, I just
  estimated it as the second half of October.

The sources of these events are 
- Pratt, Fletcher. Ordeal by Fire. New York: William Sloane, 1948. - Catton, Bruce. The Civil War. New York: Fairfax, 1971. - Guinnane, Timothy W. and Rosen, Harvey S. and Willard, Kristen L, "Turning Points in the Civil War: Views from the Greenback Market. American Economic Review. 1996.</p>

    <p>Price of Gold in Confederate Currency (Graybacks) from McCandless

Biweekly grayback price series from McCandless (1996), Appendix Table
1, p. 669.

    The data for the South comes from a newspaper column (of unknown
    origin) found glued into a blank back page of the Virginia State
    Library's copy of Ernest A. Smith's (1901) The History of the
    Confederate Treasury.

    As best I can tell, this Southern data set has not been used
    before. The standardreference is from the Hammond papers, a copy
    of a card issued by the Wm. B. Isaacs & Co., bankers with monthly
    prices for the North on one side and for the South on the
    other. This is the source of the frequently referenced Southern
    prices in Todd's Confederate Finance. An additional source of
    Southern prices is from a letter to the New York Evening Post of
    August 4, 1896 where prices are given for every 10 days. The
    author of the letter is identified only as E. C. M. The data from
    the Isaccs and ECM sources are similar to what I use.

Weidenmier (2002) discusses problems with this series, contrasting it 
with his data.

    Problems with the grayback series is that it reports constant prices
    for weeks at a time, is of unknown origin for an unknown market, is
    inconsistent with the New York Evening Post price series (On Jan 1,
    1865 the Post lists a price of 34 for 1 while McCandless reports 60
    for 1), and it is unclear whether they are bid or ask prices. \textcite{Weidenmier2002}

From Weidenmier (2002), p. 878

   An extensive search of more than a dozen newspapers yielded a
   series of 486 grayback prices from public auctions and private
   brokerage trades in Richmond between May 27, 1861, and February 15,
   1865.

From Weidenmier (2002), footnote 2, p. 878

    All quotes are taken from Richmond except during some
    stretches in the summer and fall of 1864 when Richmond
    newspapers stopped reporting money prices. These periods are
    filled in by gold price quotations from the nearby Wilmington,
    North Carolina, money market, whose prices were often quoted
    in the Richmond newspapers.  Newspapers from Petersburg, North
    Carolina, Virginia,Mobile, Alabama, Wilmington, Virginia,
    Raleigh, North Carolina, Lynchburg, Augusta, Georgia,
    Columbus, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, were also
    examined for price quotes from the Richmond market(see
    Appendix).Often, these papers would quote trades not reported
    in the Richmond newspapers.  In addition, secondary markets
    existed in most of these cities, although these gold exchanges
    tended to be considerably less liquid than the Richmond
    market.

From Weidenmier (2002), p. 890,

    Grayback/gold price quotations were taken from the following
    newspapers:Richmond Dispatch, Richmond Examiner, Richmond
    Whig, Richmond Enquirer, Petersburg Express,
    Wilmington Journal, Columbus Daily-Sun,
    Charleston Mercury,Lynchburg Virginian,and the Mobile
    Tribune.Richmondgrayback/gold price quotations were also

Wesley Mitchell's (1903) daily series of the price of a gold dollar in greenbacks in New York.
Note from Mitchell (1903), p. 423

    Explanatory Note. There are two well-authenticated tables that
    show the average monthly and yearly value of currency in gold
    during the Civil War: (1) a table published by the American
    Almanac (see, e.g., issue of 1889, p. 3(1); (2) a table
    prepared by the Bureau of Statistics (Finance, Commerce and
    Immigration of the United States, Series of 1895--96, No. 4,
    p. 518). For the years 1862--65 these tables are identical; the
    figures given below are taken from the second. This table was
    prepared by Mr. E B. Elliott, actuary of tho treasury, in the
    following manner: four dally quotations of the rates of gold
    at New York, viz., the opening, highest, lowest, and closing
    prices, were recorded; from them a daily average was made, and
    from these average daily prices was prepared the average rate
    for each month.

    The table of daily highest and lowest prices is based, for the
    reasons assigned in the text (Part II, chap, iii, sec. i), upon
    the tables given in the Report of the Chamber of Commerce of the
    State of New York for 1865-66, Part II, pp. 130--33. The figures
    for the first eleven days of January, 1862, however, are supplied
    from the daily reports of the premium on gold in the New York
    Commercial Advertiser.

Daily series of the price of a gold dollar in greenbacks in New York from Wesley C. Mitchell *Gold, Prices, and Wages under the Greenback Standard*, Appendix, Table 1: "Daily highest and lowest premium on gold and price of greenbacks in gold", pp. 288--338.
Mitchell's more extensive discussion of these data on p. 185--187.

    The price of gold in currency, as determined by transactions in these
    New York markets, was regularly reported by telegraph in all
    considerable towns of the United States, and everywhere accepted as
    authoritative. There is no necessity for taking account of the premium
    on gold in other places, because local markets were dominated by the
    New York quotations. The money columns of the daily newspapers and the
    weekly or monthly issues of the financial journals gave full reports
    of current fluctuations, and more permanent records were made by the
    compilation of a number of tables showing the highest and lowest
    prices each day for a series of years. Such tables may be found in
    *Hunt's Merchants' Magazine*, the *Commercial and Financial Chronicle*,
    the *Bankers' Magazine*, and the annual *Reports of the Chamber of
    Commerce of the State of New York*.

    All of these tables appear to be constructed in the same general
    manner from the recorded transactions of the most important of the
    New York markets. From January 13, 1862, to June 20, 1864, they
    are based upon sales at the stock exchange. On June 21 the "gold
    bill" went into effect and stopped all dealing in gold outside the
    private offices of brokers. From this time until the repeal of the
    "gold bill" by the act of July 2, there was no organized market,
    and the quotations are those ruling on the street. After the
    repeal, transactions in gold on the stock exchange were
    infrequent, and most of the business was done in the "gold room."
    From July 1864 on, therefore, the tables are based upon the latter
    market.

    In studying the fluctuations in the gold value of the paper
    currency it is necessary to go back to these records of the daily
    premium. As the differences between the tables mentioned are
    slight, it matters little which set is accepted as a basis for the
    investigation. I have decided to use the tables published in the
    chamber of commerce reports, not only because of the official
    character of the source from which they are taken, but also
    because they contain fewer obvious errors of the press than some
    of the others. To adapt them better to the purposes of the present
    chapter I have altered their form. As published, the tables show
    the highest and lowest price paid each day in currency for $100 in
    gold. This form of statement gives the impression that the
    fluctuations were due to extraordinary changes in the valuation at
    which gold was held by the community, whereas in fact they were
    due mainly to changes in the community's valuation of the notes of
    the government. When the market quotation was 200 the explanation,
    of course, was not that men esteemed gold twice as highly as they
    had done in 1861, but rather that they esteemed the paper currency
    but half as highly as they had when it was redeemable in specie. A
    much juster impression of the significance of the change in the
    relative values of gold and paper money is therefore given by
    quoting currency at a discount in gold than by quoting gold at a
    premium in paper; by saying, to use a numerical example, that $100
    in greenbacks was-worth $50 in gold, than by saying that $100 in
    gold was worth $200 in greenbacks. For this reason the chamber of
    commerce tables for the years 1862 to 1865 have been converted
    into tables showing the highest and lowest daily prices of
    currency in gold. These tables, given in full in the Appendix,
    furnish a basis for studying the remarkable changes in the gold
    value of the currency during the Civil War.

The original data source for Mitchell is the *Report of the Chamber of Commerce*, which can be found at http://books.google.com/books?id=9X8pAAAAYAAJ. 
This data in this table was taken from `EH.net Greenback Series <http://eh.net/databases/greenback/>`. The associated documentation reads,

    We did not collect the data in the usual sense; we simply copied it from the tables in:

    Mitchell, Wesley C., 1903. A history of the Greenbacks. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.

However, Mitchell (1903) only includes greenback prices from 1862-1865 on pp. 425-428. they must have actually copied it from Mitchell (1908) which  has prices from 1903-1908.
Mitchell (1908, p. 2-3) discusses the data,

    The prices of gold in these various exchanges were regularly reported
    in the financial columns of the daily papers-often in much detail. The
    financial journals-such as *Hunt's Merchants' Magazine*, the *Bankers'
    Magazine*, and the *Commercial and Financial Chronicle* --- usually
    contented themselves with publishing the opening, highest, lowest, and
    closing prices for each day. At intervals they compiled summary tables
    of daily highest and lowest prices for months or years. Similar tables
    were included in the statistical reports of such bodies as the Chamber
    of Commerce of the State of New York, and in the almanacs issued by
    various newspapers.

    A more detailed record of the price of gold was preserved for most of
    the years of the paper standard in an annual publication issued by
    Mr. J. C. Mersereau, Register of the Gold Exchange, under the title
    "American Gold, 1862-(date of issue)." This little volume usually gave
    for the preceding year the quotation for gold at ten o'clock and every
    quarter hour thereafter until three in the afternoon of each business
    day, and in all cases it gave the highest and lowest prices for every
    business day from January 13, 1862, when gold was first quoted on the
    Stock Exchange to the end of the previous year.  

    The tables of daily highest and lowest prices of gold found in the
    most important of these sources---namely: the *Commercial and Financial
    Chronicle*, the *Reports of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of
    New York*, and Mersereau's *American Gold* --- are in close agreement
    with each other. Numerous small discrepancies exist --- the quotations
    frequently vary by an eighth, sometimes by a quarter; but it matters
    little which set of tables is followed. Since Mersereau was the
    official register of the Gold Exchange, however, his tables take
    precedence in authority. Accordingly, Table 1, in the appendix, which
    gives the daily highest and lowest prices of gold, is based on
    "*American Gold*, 1862-1878''—the latest issue of Mersereau's annual I
    have been able to find. To guard against repeating the typographical
    errors which occur in Mersereau's table I have collated it with the
    Chamber of Commerce table and made several corrections. Since
    Mersereau's table is not available for 1878, the Chamber of Commerce
    figures, checked by those of the Commercial and Financial Chronicle,
    are used for the last year of the paper standard. To save space the
    premium on gold is given, instead of the price of gold in currency;
    and, to facilitate study of the depreciation in the specie value of
    the currency, columns have been added giving the prices of greenbacks
    in gold corresponding to the daily highest and lowest premiums on gold
    in greenbacks.

    Mersereau does not state explicitly from what markets his quotations
    are taken; but comparison with other reports indicate that they refer
    to the Stock Exchange for January 13, 1862, to June 20, 1864, and
    thereafter to the Gold Exchange, except for the first part of October,
    1869, when the Gold Exchange was closed and dealings were conducted on
    the Stock Exchange. The data for January 1-11, 1862, I have supplied
    from the financial columns of New York daily papers.

The original data in Mitchell includes columns for "Premium on gold" and "Price of Greenbacks in Gold". The Willard, et. al. version only includes the greenback prices column.
I was not able to find a full-text version of the original source of Mitchell's data, "American Gold" by J.C. Mersereau on Google books (October 2011).
[Mitchell1903]_ (p. 425-428) includes a similar table of greenback prices in gold for the years 1862-1865, which uses *Report of the Chamber of Commerce of the of New York* for 1865-66, Part II, pp. 130-33 as its source.</p>
